{"prompt":"Medium 4s code should count by 2s up to 10 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Why is it an infinite loop?","code":"count ← 0\nREPEAT UNTIL (count = 10) {\n  count ← count + 2\n  DISPLAY(count)\n}","choices":["count starts at 0, so the first increment makes it 2, then 4... wait, this works. Actually, if count started at 1, it would skip 10. Let's fix the code to count <- 1.","The loop condition should be count > 10","The variable count should be decreased","The increment should be count + 1"],"correctIndex":0}
